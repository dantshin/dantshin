- 👋 Hi, I’m @dantshin. I'm a "Digital Collaboration Specialist" working at UNDP. My role is currently focused on elevating digital literacy of personnel in UNDP - upskilling on our corporate apps and tools.
- 👀 I’m interested in Microsoft 365 tech stack: Microsoft List (aka SPO List) formatting, Adaptive Cards, Power Automate, Power Query, Power Shell
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things in the Microsoft Practices and Patterns (PnP) stack
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well, the above
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at daniel [dot] tshin [at] undp.org - my focus is on my internal clients, so I am unable to respond to cold calls or emails with insufficent details.
